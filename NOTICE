NOTICE
======

Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk, and may
not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work
against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade foreign
exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level
of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could
sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore
you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should
be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and
seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any
doubts. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future
results.

DISCLAIMER

We do not endorse and, or recommend any of the said brokers and, or any
other such sites; the links here have been provided as an information
in a hope that these could be useful.
